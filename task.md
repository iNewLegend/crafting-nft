React Page for creating an NFT

Task Description:
The React page will include several input fields to receive details about the NFT to be created
(e.g., name, description, image file) and a button that allows the user to make the NFT using the 
Metamask wallet installed in the browser.

The goal is to understand the process of connecting to the wallet, 
creating a transaction, and completing it by the user.
